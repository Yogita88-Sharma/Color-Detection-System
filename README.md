# Color-Detection-System
The Color Detection App is a Python-based tool that uses OpenCV, Pandas, and Tkinter to identify and display the closest color match for any clicked pixel on an image using a CSV-based color dataset. It offers an interactive GUI for easy image and color detection functionality.
The application uses OpenCV to process the image and detect pixel colors, Pandas to handle the color dataset, and Tkinter to create a user-friendly graphical interface. The color matching is performed using a CSV file that contains color names along with their RGB values, which the user can load into the app.

Key Features:
CSV-Based Color Matching: The app compares the clicked pixelâ€™s color with a dataset of colors and displays the closest match.
Responsive Image Resizing: Automatically resizes the image for display in the app window while preserving accurate color detection from the original image dimensions.
Interactive GUI: Users can easily upload images, load color datasets, and click on the image to detect colors.
This tool is ideal for tasks requiring accurate color identification, whether for design, art, or coding projects that involve color selection.
